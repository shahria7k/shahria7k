# I Do  
- **Coding**
- **Product Design** (Turning your “I don’t know what I want” into something usable, as always.)  
- **System Design** (Building systems that work so seamlessly, you’ll forget they exist. Magic, right?)  
- **Wrangle Stress** (I thrive under pressure—if I’m not stressed, I’m probably not doing my job right.)  
- **Handle Crisis** (When everything’s falling apart, I’m the one keeping it together, as usual.)

But mostly, I’m a **conductor**. I panic when I’m not under stress or racing against a deadline—but that’s where I thrive. I turn that panic into progress and deliver results.

### My Expertise  
- ERP Development, Business Process Management, Business Process Automation, Business Process Optimization (Making processes so efficient, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without them.)  
- Supply Chain, HRM, Financial Accounting (The “boring” stuff that somehow holds everything together. You're welcome.)  
- Node.js, React, React Native, TypeScript, MongoDB (I speak JavaScript fluently, and it’s not as easy as it sounds.)  
- Tailwind CSS, Figma (Designing interfaces that are actually pleasant to use—imagine that!)  
- Documentation, SOP Development (Writing docs that even I can understand later, a rare skill, I know.)  
- Project Management, CI/CD (Making sure everything is on track, even when it’s not. Stress is my friend.)  
- Google Cloud, Firebase, Serverless Architecture (Taking infrastructure headaches off your plate—because no one has time for that.)  
- Microservices, CLEAN Architecture, System Design, Product Design (Building scalable systems, because “quick fixes” only last so long.)

### A Bit About Me  
- I love **coffee (espresso)**, **walking**, and **looking at nature**. (Because sometimes, the best inspiration strikes far from the screen.)  
- I avoid arguments but thrive in **good relationships**. (After all, why argue when you’re always right?)  
- **Natural beauty**, **productivity**, and **solving people's problems** are the nutrition to my soul. (I’m just here to make life easier. No big deal.)  
- My purpose? To consume as much of this nutrition as possible while appreciating and being grateful for it all. (Appreciating the little things—even when juggling a hundred tasks—keeps me grounded.)
