# I Do  
- **Coding**: Turning ideas into functional, scalable software.  
- **Product Design**: Designing solutions that users love to interact with.  
- **System Design**: Building systems that don’t just work—they excel.  
- **Wrangle Stress**: Turning chaos into clarity, no matter the challenge.  
- **Handle Crisis**: Managing the unmanageable with precision and poise.  

But mostly, I’m a **conductor**. I panic when I’m not under stress or racing against a deadline—but that’s where I thrive. I turn that panic into progress and deliver results.
